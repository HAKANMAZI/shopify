Completedworks x Ekaterina Bazhenova Yamasaki

Goliath's sculptural form reflects a conceptual, theme-based approach, which
stands in stark contrast to the classical rules of decoration that pervade
traditional ceramics. The flowing contours of the piece reference the way
drapery has been used by painters to convey movement since the Renaissance.

**In stock: Order before 12pm GMT for same weekday despatch**

  

Details

The piece is thoughtfully handcrafted. It has a height of 18.5cm, a width of
18cm and a depth of 17cm at it's highest, widest and deepest points. Goliath
has a matte surface that is rough to touch and that lends it an imposing
quality. It can stand on its own as a sculptural object without any floral
arrangement.

This is a ring replete with all the right details – ample volume on top,
perfected shanks, lightly contoured form. It carries the silhouette, albeit
somewhat distorted, of that classic signet your great-uncle* wore without the
weight of history and class politics. You can engrave it with a shield if you
want – but we won’t help you with that. An alternative to streetwear’s
reinvention of the signet.

(*We would not presume to have a guess at his name here.)

This is a ring replete with all the right details – ample volume on top,
perfected shanks, lightly contoured form. It carries the silhouette, albeit
somewhat distorted, of that classic signet your great-uncle* wore without the
weight of history and class politics. You can engrave it with a shield if you
want – but we won’t help you with that. An alternative to streetwear’s
reinvention of the signet.

**Completedworks x Ekaterina Bazhenova Yamasaki**

**Deceptively simple, yet soulful, this vase is designed for unexpected and
irreverent floral arrangements.**

Its sculptural form reflects the maker’s, Ekaterina Bazhenova Yamasaki,
conceptual, theme-based approach, which stands in stark contrast to the
classical rules of decoration that pervade traditional ceramics. The flowing
contours of the piece reference the way drapery has been used by painters to
convey movement since the Renaissance.

**About the Collection**

Fold was developed in collaboration with mixed media artist Ekaterina
Bazhenova Yamasaki, as a continuation of an ongoing study into the way
materials can deceive. Presented as a collection of fine jewellery and vases,
each piece exhibits its own expressive potential through the folds and creases
that make up its form. Materials deceive, with the hard metal and porcelain
forms appearing to imitate the visual properties of another more supple
material such as foam.

**Custom made - Despatch in 4-6 weeks**

Details

Filled with an uncomplicated grace and a gentle ease, these are the earrings
that transcend the week – going with you to work, beautifully clinging through

rippling, tumbling, ruffling effects of the winds across Yorkshire’s moors
which inspired them, of course. If the vermeil fades or you lose the butterfly
clips just let us know and we will sort you out – we already know you are
going to be wearing them a lot.

**Completedworks x Ekaterina Bazhenova Yamasaki**

**Deceptively simple, yet soulful, this fruit bowl is designed for unexpected
and irreverent fruit arrangements.**

Its sculptural form reflects the artist's, Ekaterina Bazhenova Yamasaki,
conceptual, theme-based approach, which stands in stark contrast to the
classical rules of decoration that pervade traditional ceramics. The flowing
contours of the piece reference the way drapery has been used by painters to
convey movement since the Renaissance.

**About the Collection**

Fold was developed in collaboration with mixed media artist Ekaterina
Bazhenova Yamasaki, as a continuation of an ongoing study into the way
materials can deceive. Presented as a collection of fine jewellery and vases,
each piece exhibits its own expressive potential through the folds and creases
that make up its form. Materials deceive, with the hard metal and porcelain
forms appearing to imitate the visual properties of another more supple
material such as foam.

**In stock: Order before 12pm GMT for same weekday despatch**

**Completedworks x Ekaterina Bazhenova Yamasaki**

**Deceptively simple, yet soulful, this vase is designed for unexpected and
irreverent floral arrangements.**

Its sculptural form reflects the maker’s, Ekaterina Bazhenova Yamasaki,
conceptual, theme-based approach, which stands in stark contrast to the
classical rules of decoration that pervade traditional ceramics. The flowing
contours of the piece reference the way drapery has been used by painters to
convey movement since the Renaissance.

**About the Collection**

Fold was developed in collaboration with mixed media artist Ekaterina
Bazhenova Yamasaki, as a continuation of an ongoing study into the way
materials can deceive. Presented as a collection of fine jewellery and vases,
each piece exhibits its own expressive potential through the folds and creases
that make up its form. Materials deceive, with the hard metal and porcelain
forms appearing to imitate the visual properties of another more supple
material such as foam.

**In stock: Order before 12pm GMT for same weekday despatch**

which inspired them, of course. If the vermeil fades or you lose the butterfly
clips just let us know and we will sort you out – we already know you are
going to be wearing them a lot.
